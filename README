Rail Switcher

Allows you to turn rails or swap out different types of rails(powered, detector, or normal) with each other by right clicking on rail with a rail or shears

Changelog:

Coming soon:
* Added permission to plugin.yml
* Use plugin logger instead of Minecraft logger

Version 1.0.2 (10/30/2012)
* Added WorldGuard support
* Adding Metrics support. To opt out, set "opt-out: true" in PluginMetrics/config.yml
* Removed the need for Vault, any permission will do.
* Partially fixed right clicking with rail to swap out rails (ex: holding a powered rail and swapping out a regular rail) or rotate them
** Apparently it is a client bug that killed this functionality.  This helps, but will hit the closest one to you instead of the one you are aiming at.
** For precision rotating, I suggest to stick with the shears. If swapping out rails, stand on the rail or to a side without any rails in the way.
* Added stairs, beacon, anvil, walls, and tripwire to default blocks list.
