Rail Switcher

Allows you to turn rails or swap out different types of rails(powered, detector, activator, or normal) with each other by right clicking on rail with a rail or shears in hand.

Changelog:

Coming Soon:
* Removed extra TRAP_DOOR in default block list.

Version 1.0.3 (3/17/2013)
* Added permission to plugin.yml
* Use plugin logger instead of Minecraft logger
* Added Activator Rails
* Updated placeable block list.
* Improved click placement when holding rails.
** When using any rail, it now will get the block that you are LOOKING at.  This is not the same as the block that is TARGETED.
** I still have no way to get the targeted block when using rails, but this is working much better than the previous method.
* Updated Metrics
* Moved defaultBlocks.txt and customBlocks.txt under the lists folder.
* Added "/railswitcher reload" to command to reload config files (currently just lists)
** Can only use if you are an op or have permission "railswitcher.adjust"
* Since github dropped support for their version of downloads, I have set up a new folder structure under downloads:
** release: always has the latest official version
** dev: always has the most up to date version (could be the official or a development/test version)
** old: storage of all old versions in case somebody wants to download an older version.

Version 1.0.2 (10/30/2012)
* Added WorldGuard support
* Adding Metrics support. To opt out, set "opt-out: true" in PluginMetrics/config.yml
* Removed the need for Vault, any permission will do.
* Partially fixed right clicking with rail to swap out rails (ex: holding a powered rail and swapping out a regular rail) or rotate them
** Apparently it is a client bug that killed this functionality.  This helps, but will hit the closest one to you instead of the one you are aiming at.
** For precision rotating, I suggest to stick with the shears. If swapping out rails, stand on the rail or to a side without any rails in the way.
* Added stairs, beacon, anvil, walls, and tripwire to default blocks list.

Version 1.0.1 (3/13/2012)
